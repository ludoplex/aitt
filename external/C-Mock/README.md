Overview
--------

C Mock is [Google Mock](https://github.com/google/googletest)'s extension allowing a function mocking.

This is neither a patch to nor fork of Google Mock. This is just a set of headers providing a way to use tools for mock methods with mock functions in tests.

C Mock is not intended to promote a bad design. Its goal is to aid the developers test their code.
